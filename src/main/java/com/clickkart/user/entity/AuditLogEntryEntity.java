/**
 * One audited event, linked by hash to the one before it.
 *
 * <p><strong>Append-only.</strong> Every column is {@code updatable = false} and the repository
 * exposes no delete, so there is no supported way to change or remove an entry once written. That is
 * the point: an audit trail an operator can edit answers no question anyone would ask it.
 *
 * <p>{@code entryHash} covers this entry's own fields <em>and</em> its predecessor's hash, so
 * altering any row invalidates every hash after it. Deleting or reordering rows breaks the links.
 * {@code AuditTrailService.verifyChainIntegrity()} recomputes the lot and says where it broke.
 *
 * <p><strong>Never put personal data in {@code details}.</strong> This table is retained far longer
 * than the rows it describes and survives an erasure request that scrubs the profile itself -
 * recording the shape of a change (which fields, how many addresses) rather than its content is what
 * keeps a customer's home address out of a second, longer-lived store.
