/**
 * The tip of this service's audit hash chain. Exactly one row, always id {@value #SINGLETON_ID}.
 *
 * <p>Holding the last entry's hash in its own row is what makes the chain append-only in practice
 * rather than in principle: a writer locks this row, reads the hash it must link to, writes its
 * entry, and advances the head - so two concurrent writers cannot both link to the same predecessor
 * and fork the chain.
 *
 * <p><strong>The id is assigned, not generated</strong>, which is where this diverges from Auth
 * Service's copy. Auth's chain head inherits {@code BaseEntity}'s sequence generator, so the row it
 * seeds only lands on id 1 because it happens to be the first row that sequence ever issues - if
 * anything else claimed the sequence first, {@code lockForUpdate(1L)} would find nothing and every
 * audited write would fail. Fixing the id here removes that coupling entirely: the row is id 1
 * because it is declared to be, not because of when it was created.
 *
 * <p>It therefore does not extend {@code BaseEntity} either. The created/updated stamps that base
 * class adds describe who last changed a row, which is meaningless for a counter that only ever
 * moves forward and is never edited by a person.
