/**
 * The Audit Log Service is a required dependency, matching how Auth Service treats it: on
 * open-circuit or error this logs locally at WARN with full detail (so the event isn't lost
 * entirely even though the request is about to fail) and then throws {@link
 * DownstreamServiceUnavailableException}, which Feign propagates to the caller as if the
 * underlying call had thrown it.
 *
 * <p>The service layer does not catch it, so the surrounding transaction rolls back and the write
 * never happens - a profile change is never persisted without a corresponding audit entry. The
 * trade-off is accepted deliberately: an unaudited write is a permanent, undetectable gap in a
 * tamper-evident chain, whereas a failed request is visible and retryable. It also means an audit
 * entry can exist for a change that later failed to commit; that direction is at least detectable,
 * because the entry names the correlation id of a request the caller saw fail.
